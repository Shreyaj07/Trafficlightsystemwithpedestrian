# Trafficlightsystemwithpedestrian
This is a 4-way Arduino traffic system that has a main and a 
pedestrian lighting circuit. As soon as the pedestrian button is 
pressed, the program waits till the main process tries to jump to 
the next state before performing a pedestrian cycle.
This system was designed to control vehicular movement as well 
as assist pedestrians crossing with an interruptible bush button. 
The button when pushed will interrupt the normal sequence of 
the traffic control and thus start the pedestrian crossing cycle for 
a predetermined period of time. This will, therefore, allow people 
to cross the road.The programming platform for the simulation 
of the Arduino traffic light system was done purely with the 
Arduino IDE.
All the LEDs are connected to the Arduino UNO’s digital I/O pins 
through respective current limiting resistors of 1KΩ.All the 
connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
